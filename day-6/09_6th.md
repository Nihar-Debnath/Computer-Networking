# 🟩 6️⃣ SIXTH ROW OF IPv4 HEADER

From the diagram, the 6th row is:

```
| Options (0–40 bytes) | Padding |
```

👉 **This row is OPTIONAL**
👉 It may exist **or may not exist**

That’s why IPv4 header size can be:

* **Minimum = 20 bytes**
* **Maximum = 60 bytes**

---

## First: Why does this row exist at all?

### 🌍 Real-world idea 📦

Normally, a courier label contains:

* Sender address
* Receiver address
* Weight

That’s enough **most of the time**.

But sometimes, sender wants **special instructions** like:

* “Take photo on delivery”
* “Use safest route”
* “Record every checkpoint”

👉 These **extra instructions** are **not common**, so they’re kept **optional**.

That is exactly what **Options** are.

---

## 1️⃣ Options field (0 to 40 bytes)

### 🌍 Real-world analogy 📝

**Special delivery instructions**

Examples in networking:

* Record the route taken by packet
* Add timestamp at each router
* Security-related info

### In IPv4:

* Options field length = **variable**
* Can be:

  * **0 bytes** (most common)
  * Up to **40 bytes**

📌 Because this field is rarely used:

* Routers dislike it
* It slows down packet processing

---

## 2️⃣ Padding – *Why is this needed?*

### 🌍 Real-world analogy 📏

Imagine:

* Form must be filled in **blocks of 4 lines**
* You used only **3 lines**
* You add **1 empty line** to complete the block

That empty line = **padding**

---

### In IPv4:

* Header must be a **multiple of 32 bits (4 bytes)**
* Options may not perfectly fit
* Padding adds **extra 0s** to align size

📌 Padding has **no meaning**
📌 Just for **alignment**

---

## 🧠 VERY IMPORTANT CONNECTION (IHL + Options)

Remember **IHL (Header Length)** from 1st row?

👉 IHL tells:

> “How long the header is INCLUDING options + padding”

Example:

* No options → IHL = 5 (20 bytes)
* Options present → IHL > 5

---

## 🧠 EXAM-READY SUMMARY (MUST REMEMBER)

> **The 6th row of the IPv4 header contains optional fields for special network instructions, and padding is added to ensure the header length remains a multiple of 32 bits.**

---

## ⚠️ REAL-WORLD NOTE (IMPORTANT)

* Options are **almost never used today**
* They slow routers
* IPv6 removed most of this complexity

---

## 🔚 BIG PICTURE (Header Complete)

You have now fully covered:

1. Row 1 → version, size, priority, length
2. Row 2 → fragmentation
3. Row 3 → TTL, protocol, checksum
4. Row 4 → source IP
5. Row 5 → destination IP
6. Row 6 → options + padding

👉 **IPv4 header DONE.**
