## 🖧 Functionalities of Computer Networks (CN)

Computer Networks allow multiple computing devices to connect, communicate, and share resources. Their main **functionalities** include:

---

### **1. Communication**

* Enables devices to exchange data and messages.
* Example: Sending an email, video call, or chat message.
* Protocols used: TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.

---

### **2. Resource Sharing**

* Users can share hardware (printers, scanners), software, and data files.
* Example: Many computers sharing one printer in an office LAN.

---

### **3. Data and File Transfer**

* Facilitates fast and secure transfer of files across systems.
* Example: Downloading files from a server or sharing via cloud storage.

---

### **4. Centralized Data Management**

* Data can be stored and managed centrally on servers.
* Example: In a university, all student data stored on one central database accessible from different departments.

---

### **5. Remote Access**

* Allows users to access systems or data from different geographical locations.
* Example: Logging into a company’s server from home using VPN.

---

### **6. Scalability**

* Networks can easily add or remove devices without major changes.
* Example: Adding new computers to an existing office LAN.

---

### **7. Fault Tolerance and Reliability**

* Data can be rerouted in case of link failure.
* Example: Internet routing automatically finds another path if one route fails.

---

### **8. Security and Access Control**

* Ensures authorized access and protects data from unauthorized users.
* Example: Firewalls, encryption (SSL/TLS), authentication systems.

---

### **9. Distributed Processing**

* Computational tasks can be divided among multiple computers for efficiency.
* Example: Cloud computing and parallel processing in data centers.

---

### **10. Internet and Cloud Services**

* Provides access to web applications, email, and cloud storage.
* Example: Google Drive, AWS, Microsoft Azure.
