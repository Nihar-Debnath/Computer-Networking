A **Personal Area Network** connects devices within a **small range (a few meters)**, typically around one person.

### 🔹 Range:

1–10 meters

### 🔹 Devices Used:

Smartphones, laptops, smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, etc.

### 🔹 Example:

* Connecting your **phone to wireless earphones via Bluetooth**
* **Mobile Hotspot** sharing internet to your laptop
* **Smartwatch syncing** with your phone

### 🔹 Diagram:

```
[Phone] 🔄 [Smartwatch]
   🔄
 [Laptop] 🔄 [Bluetooth Speaker]
```

## 🏠 2. Local Area Network (LAN)

### 🔹 Definition:

A **Local Area Network** connects multiple computers and devices **within a small area** such as a home, school, or office.

### 🔹 Range:

Up to 1 kilometer (within one building or campus)

### 🔹 Devices Used:

Switches, routers, Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi access points

### 🔹 Example:

* All computers in your **college lab connected to one printer and file server**
* A **home Wi-Fi network** connecting multiple devices to one router

### 🔹 Diagram:

```
   [PC1]     [PC2]     [Printer]
       \       |       /
        \      |      /
        [Switch/Router]
             |
         [Internet]
```

## 🏫 3. Campus Area Network (CAN)

### 🔹 Definition:

A **Campus Area Network** interconnects **multiple LANs within a limited area like a university or business campus**.

### 🔹 Range:

Up to 5–10 kilometers

### 🔹 Devices Used:

Routers, fiber-optic cables, managed switches

### 🔹 Example:

* **University Network** connecting multiple departments, libraries, hostels, and labs.
* **Corporate Campus Network** connecting multiple office buildings.

### 🔹 Diagram:

```
[Dept A LAN]---\
[Dept B LAN]----> [Campus Backbone Router] ---> [Internet]
[Library LAN]--/
```

## 🏙️ 4. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

### 🔹 Definition:

A **Metropolitan Area Network** connects multiple **LANs spread across a city or a large town**.

### 🔹 Range:

Up to 50 kilometers

### 🔹 Devices Used:

High-speed fiber cables, routers, microwave links

### 🔹 Example:

* **City-wide Wi-Fi networks** (like Kolkata Municipal Wi-Fi)
* **Cable TV networks**
* **Banks interconnecting branches across a city**

### 🔹 Diagram:

```
[Bank Branch 1 LAN] \
[Bank Branch 2 LAN]  -->  [City Router Backbone] ---> [Internet]
[Bank Branch 3 LAN] /
```

## 🌍 5. Wide Area Network (WAN)

### 🔹 Definition:

A **Wide Area Network** covers **large geographic areas such as countries or continents**, interconnecting multiple MANs and LANs.

### 🔹 Range:

100 km to global

### 🔹 Devices Used:

Satellite links, undersea cables, routers, gateways, modems

### 🔹 Example:

* The **Internet** itself 🌐
* **Banking networks** connecting all branches nationwide
* **Multinational companies** connecting offices worldwide via VPN

## 🧠 Quick Analogy

Think of them as **expanding circles**:

```
PAN < LAN < CAN < MAN < WAN
```

➡️ The farther you go,
• the **bigger** the area,
• the **slower** the speed,
• the **more complex** the infrastructure.
